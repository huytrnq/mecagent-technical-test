# CADQuery Code Generator ‚Äî Technical Assessment Report

## üéØ Task Summary

The objective was to develop a model that generates CadQuery code from rendered images of 3D objects. This presents a unique challenge in **vision-to-code translation**, requiring the model to ground visual representations into precise geometric and syntactic structures that match a CAD programming language.

## üîß Approach & Model Selection

Due to time and hardware constraints, I implemented a focused experimental setup:
- **Fine-tuning** a vision-language model (Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct) 
- **Training data**: 1k-sample subset of the GenCAD-Code dataset
- **Validation**: 20 test samples for comprehensive evaluation
- **Assessment**: Code syntax validation and shape similarity metrics (IoU)

### Why Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct?
- **Instruction-following capability**: Optimized for structured output generation, increasing likelihood of well-formatted CadQuery code
- **Computational efficiency**: 3B parameters with 4-bit quantization enables training on a single 24GB GPU
- **Vision-language integration**: Strong multimodal understanding for image-to-code tasks

## üìä Dataset and Preprocessing

**Dataset**: [CADCODER/GenCAD-Code](https://huggingface.co/datasets/CADCODER/GenCAD-Code)
- **Size**: 147,000+ training pairs
- **Content**: Each sample contains:
  - üñºÔ∏è Rendered 3D object image
  - üìù Natural language prompt for code generation  
  - üíª Corresponding CadQuery code snippet

**Experimental Setup**:
- **Training set**: 1,000 randomly sampled pairs (due to computational constraints)
- **Validation set**: 20 pairs for comprehensive evaluation
- **Rationale**: While small, this subset demonstrates model capabilities when syntactically correct code is generated

> **Note**: The validation process involves mesh generation for IoU calculation, which is computationally intensive. The 20-sample validation set provides a reasonable balance between evaluation thoroughness and computational feasibility.

## üöÄ Results Summary

### Key Metrics
| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Valid Syntax Rate (VSR)** | 100% (20/20) | ‚úÖ All generated code is syntactically correct |
| **Mean IoU Best** | 0.052 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Low shape similarity (expected with limited training data) |
| **Top IoU Score** | 0.281 | üéØ Best case demonstrates potential |

### Performance Analysis
- **‚úÖ Syntax Success**: Perfect syntax rate indicates strong code structure learning
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Shape Accuracy**: Low IoU scores reflect limited training data and shape complexity
- **üîÑ Consistency**: All 20 samples generated valid, executable CadQuery code

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### 1. **Scale Training Data**
- **Current**: 1k samples ‚Üí **Target**: Full 147k dataset
- **Expected Impact**: Significant improvement in shape accuracy and generalization

### 2. **Vision Encoder Fine-tuning**
- **Approach**: Fine-tune CLIP backbone on CAD-specific visual features
- **Benefit**: Better understanding of geometric relationships and CAD-relevant visual patterns

### 3. **Training Monitoring & Regularization**
- Implement comprehensive metrics tracking during training
- Add early stopping and overfitting prevention mechanisms
- Monitor both syntax and semantic correctness

### 4. **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**
- **Strategy**: Reward models for generating code that produces high-IoU shapes
- **Implementation**: Use IoU scores as reward signals for reinforcement learning
- **Goal**: Align code generation with geometric accuracy objectives

### 5. **Multi-stage Training Pipeline**
- Stage 1: Syntax and structure learning
- Stage 2: Shape-aware fine-tuning with IoU-based rewards
- Stage 3: Domain-specific geometric pattern optimization
